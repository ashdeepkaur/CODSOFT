            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>What is in a landing page?
                A landing page is any web page that a consumer can land on, but in the marketing realm, it's usually a standalone page, distinct from your homepage or any other page, that serves a single and focused purpose. A landing page is a follow-up to any promises that you've made in your content.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
            <h2>USE</h2>
            <p>Landing pages are ideal for merchants and ecommerce marketers who have more than one SKU on the go. Even when they've only got a single product offering, there might be multiple contexts better represented on separate pages.
